## Meaning Of MCIET

---

We usually ask our mother if there are groceries in the refrigerator that we haven't seen before. Mom, can I eat this?

We don't always wonder how long the groceries have left their shelf life or how long they've been in the fridge unless we take them out to eat them. Therefore, there are many foods that are discarded without being able to check the expiration date in advance. We wanted to solve this problem, and we created an app called MCIET (Mom Can I Eat This?) that checks the expiration date that we don't know.
